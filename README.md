## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

### What I learned

In this section, I wanted to improve my responsive web design skills and learn how to use rem and em property.

### Continued development

I would definitely continue to practice my responsive, rem, and em skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS em and rem explained by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) - This helped me understanding how to use rem and em property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
