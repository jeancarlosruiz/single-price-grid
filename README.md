## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

In this section, I wanted to improve my responsive web design skills and learn how to use rem and em property.

### Continued development

I would definitely continue to practice my responsive, rem, and em skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS em and rem explained by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) - This helped me understanding how to use rem and em property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
